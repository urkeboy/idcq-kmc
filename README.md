Image Dependent Color Quantization Using K-means Clustering.

## About

This project was done as homework on Practicum in Physics 2 at University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering, in May 2020.

## Method

We will utilize unsupervised machine learning techniques for adaptive color quantization and examine the performance of such full resolution lossy image compression methods.

## Results

We used our method to compress 5 standard public-domain test images :

2. peppers.png
3. baboon.png
4. sails.png
5. frymire.png

Compressed images are located in `/Results/`.
